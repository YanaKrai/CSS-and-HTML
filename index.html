        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am an IOS and Web Developer. I ❤️ coffee and books. </p>
        <p class="bio">I decided to code when I was 7, and that's just because I saw the movie "Hackers" , well, you know the same movie
          1995 release with Angelina Jolie in the lead roles, as it is banal but that's how it turned out. But more seriously
          then the main step in this direction I made in 2007, when I entered the University in the relevant specialty,
          namely: Software Engineering, which was successfully completed in 2012 with a Master's degree.
          But sometimes life is quite unexpected, and in the fall of the same year, due to family circumstances, I had to master other skills,
          and to get a completely different profession in less than 2 months I did it. Giving 9 years of his life to another profession, working with enthusiasm and faith that
          even one person can change the "System" in the country .... I realized that I am a very naive person)) At the end of it all, I returned to the profession I loved since childhood ...
          But in order to get back to a sufficient level of knowledge in this direction, you need to learn again .... and I also did, and continue to do. After all, learning is your development, for the benefit of others.
          Aiming to acquire skills and abilities in the field of Web development, I enrolled in a course from the online platform UDEMY, namely the course: The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp
          created by Dr. Angela Yu and she is really wonderful and inspiring)</p>
